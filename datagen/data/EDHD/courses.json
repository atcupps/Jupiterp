      "description": "An introduction to the paradigms and perspectives that guide the study of human development across the lifespan in cognitive, social, physical and emotional domains. Topics of study include overlying principles, concepts, assumptions, theoretical frameworks, and research methods that influence ways in which development is conceptualized. The course is designed to provide insight into major questions of the day in human development and how these prevailing perspectives have evolved over time.  This course will also help students understand how knowledge of theory and research is translated into practice in a variety of professional settings.",

These topics will be discussed with respect to typical and atypical development with some focus on developmental disabilities including autism, specific language impairment, reading and math impairment, and attention deficit disorders among others. This course will focus on both the theoretical perspectives and pragmatic issues of how evidence regarding brain development can or may be translated into useful or misleading information for educators, professionals, and parents/guardians of our children.",

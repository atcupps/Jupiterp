      "description": "In the age of pop music and blockbuster films, of memes and viral videos, we often forget that theatre was one of the original forms of popular entertainment.   We will focus on theatre practitioners including actors, directors, designers and backstage personnel to understand how theatre is produced.  We will also consider popular entertainment in Europe and America, with a particular focus on musical theatre and Broadway to explore how theatre communicates, resonates, and remains relevant to all audiences.",

The course aims to weave theory, history, and practice-based creative research together to give students a holistic understanding of performance within the framework of Global Asias. To begin, we will contextualize what is considered to be Global Asias, including diasporas, and its formation through recent history. From thiscenter, wewill utilize case studies of traditional theatre as well as the transformations these stories take on with the introduction of new media. With digital media production and an introduction to other emergent media methodologies at the core of the practice component, students will have the opportunity to create an adaptation of their own from our historicized source material. As a result, students will get a holistic perspective of the racial formation and identities within Global Asias, read and write their own adaptations based on the stories sourced from East Asia, and produce a short teleplay based on their collaborative creative research.",

      "description": "Techno-Orientalism is in collaboration with course JAPN447: Technologies of Japanese Performance. The course aims to weave theory, history, and practice-based creative research together to give students a holistic understanding of performance within the framework of Global Asias. To begin, we will contextualize what is considered to be Global Asias, including diasporas, and its formation through recent history. From this center, we will utilize case studies of traditional theatre as well as the transformations these stories take on with the introduction of new media. With digital media production and an introduction to other emergent media methodologies at the core of the practice component, students will have the opportunity to create an adaptation of their own from our historicized source material. As a result, students will get a holistic perspective of the racial formation and identities within Global Asias, read and write their own adaptations based on the stories sourced from East Asia, and produce a short teleplay based on their collaborative creative research.",

Students' activities include, a weekly lab to provide hands-on experience with environmental quality measurements and treatment techniques; on-site visits to regional industries that undertake sustainable practices; and a final research project where experimental design and laboratory techniques are used to assess interactions between technologies and natural systems and their potential for reducing environmental impacts.",

It is strongly recommended for PhD candidates to develop their research topic and build strong research capability. The course provides a sound understanding of the enterprise of engineering research, from selecting a thesis topic, to the development of a research proposal, to planning and executing a research plan, to writing a dissertation and publishable articles. Students will review published research reports, conduct a literature survey, and write a preliminary research proposal. Students will carry out assignments involving design of small experiments, and learn how to statistically analyze data and report results. The course comprises lectures from PM faculty and guest lecturers.<br><br> See instructor for details pertaining to in-person class meetings.",

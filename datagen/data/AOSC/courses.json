Weather affects not just our daily activities but other important aspects of society such as transportation, commerce, security and agriculture. Most people understand what weather is to some extent. Climate and climate change are concepts that evoke strong emotional responses from people but are less well understood. In this class, students examine fundamental issues such as the greenhouse effect, severe weather, and global weather patterns and how they relate to a changing climate. Instruction in the lectures will provide the basic knowledge needed to understand these issues. In the discussion sections, students will be divided into groups to address the implications of these topics through group projects.",

      "description": "The use of machine learning in the physical sciences has grown immensely over the last several years. While machine learning has been around for decades, recent advances in deep neural networks have contributed to the rapid growth of applications across many disciplines, including the physical sciences. However, many of the traditional benchmark datasets for the development of neural networks are not from the physical sciences, making the use of off-the-shelf machine learning methods not always feasible or practical for the physical sciences. In this course, we will learn the fundamentals of neural networks, from the basics of a neuron to more advanced architectures, and how these tools can be applied to the physical sciences. Important considerations for data preprocessing specific to the physical sciences will be discussed, along with how to evaluate the skill, uncertainty, and confidence of neural networks with specific relevance to the physical sciences., ,",

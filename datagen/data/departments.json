The field of science communication ventures that the answer is not simply a matter of improving capacity (e.g., because people lack scientific information, scientists lack communication skills, or both). Rather, it calls for sustained collaboration and empathy between laypersons and experts. In this hands-on, experiential course, we use a model of cultural competency to put forth solutions to bridge the expert-lay divide. We investigate typical venues in which science is communicated (museums, YouTube videos, federal agency websites, and much much more) and study best practices for communication. Then we explore emerging venues that support sustained contact between so-called \"lay citizens\" and scientific or technical experts (dance/improv techniques, ethnographic methods and citizen science). Students learn to use cross-cultural perspectives as a basis to pilot and test ways of strengthening relationships and improving communication.","sections":[{"sec_code":"0101","instructors":["Nicole Mogul"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"TuTh","start_time":[11,0,"Am"],"end_time":[12,15,"Pm"]},"location":["MMH","0108"]}}]}]},{"code":"CPSS225","name":"College Park Scholars Capstone: Science, Technology, and Society","credits":{"Amount":3},"gen_eds":["DSHS","SCIS"],"description":"Exploration and understanding of ways science and technology shape and are shaped by society.","sections":[{"sec_code":"0101","instructors":["Kuan-Hung Lo"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"TuTh","start_time":[12,30,"Pm"],"end_time":[1,45,"Pm"]},"location":["CCC","1105"]}}]}]},{"code":"CPSS240","name":"College Park Scholars: Science, Technology &amp; Society - Service-Learning Practicum","credits":{"Amount":3},"gen_eds":["DSSP","SCIS"],"description":"Supervised Service-Learning practicum in issues related to science, technology and society.","sections":[{"sec_code":"0201","instructors":["Kuan-Hung Lo"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"TuTh","start_time":[3,30,"Pm"],"end_time":[4,45,"Pm"]},"location":["CCC","1105"]}}]}]},{"code":"CPSS340","name":"College Park Scholars: Infrastructure and Society","credits":{"Amount":3},"gen_eds":["DSSP"],"description":"One of the most important, and underappreciated, aspects of our society is its infrastructure (roads, buildings, communication systems, water delivery systems, sanitation systems, energy systems, etc.).

In urban areas, the concentration of people and the drastic changes in land use, have altered the fluxes of water, sediments, chemicals, and microorganisms. As the population increases and the number of large urban areas keeps growing (both in U.S. and internationally), managing water in urban areas is becoming more challenging. Water must be supplied for domestic, commercial, and industrial use, as well as irrigation and maintaining and enhancing local environments (e.g., urban streams). In addition, stormwater must be managed to prevent flooding and environmental damage, and used water, which contains organic matter, nutrients, and other constituents that can be extracted and reused, must be collected and managed. In this course we take a systems approach to urban water hydrology, engineering, planning and management. We will explore urban water cycle, urban runoff and drainage characteristics, urban water supply and demand, stormwater collection and treatment and designing best management practices.

Thus there are many opportunities for difficulties with language, which is the focus of our field. Understanding difficulties with speech, language, and hearing require first understanding how processing works when language is successful - the psychological (behavioral) and neurobiological (brain) factors that enable people to learn and use language despite its intricacies, the structure and properties of language itself, and how knowledge of language is acquired, represented, and processed in the mind and brain.","sections":[{"sec_code":"PBH1","instructors":["Manaar Zuhurudeen"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"Tu","start_time":[6,30,"Pm"],"end_time":[9,0,"Pm"]},"location":["ARC","1103"]}}]}]},{"code":"HESP202","name":"Introduction to Hearing and Speech Sciences","credits":{"Amount":3},"gen_eds":null,"description":"An introduction to communication sciences and disorders; a survey of the bases of normal speech, language and hearing ability, major forms of communicative disorders and their treatment.","sections":[{"sec_code":"0101","instructors":["Christina Shields","Norah Aljunaidi"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"TuTh","start_time":[9,30,"Am"],"end_time":[10,45,"Am"]},"location":["TWS","0310"]}}]}]},{"code":"HESP214","name":"The Research Behind Headlines on Words, Thought, and Behavior","credits":{"Amount":3},"gen_eds":["DSHS","SCIS"],"description":"How does the human mind use language?

These are stories about how humans acquire and use language, but they ultimately address big questions about how we experience knowledge itself. In a world of unprecedented access to science journalism, did you ever read a headline about human behavior and wonder: How do we know? This class takes up the elegant ways cognitive scientists design experiments to answer crucial questions about language and thought, brain and behavior, that have no intuitive answers.

Human expansion into new ecosystems also provided opportunities for us to acquire new pathogens. While all of human history is marked by diseases caused by human migration, the Industrial Revolution greatly accelerated human mobility while planting the seeds of the human impact on climate change.

The goal is for you to learn and apply techniques of historical analysis to develop a critical understanding of how knowledge about, and practices of, physical culture supported a particular social order via the construction of difference, norms, and/or hierarchies, and ultimately contributed to some of the inequalities that endure today.","sections":[{"sec_code":"0101","instructors":["Shannon Jette"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"MW","start_time":[10,0,"Am"],"end_time":[10,50,"Am"]},"location":["SPH","1312"]}},{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"W","start_time":[1,0,"Pm"],"end_time":[1,50,"Pm"]},"location":["SPH","0305"]}}]},{"sec_code":"0102","instructors":["Shannon Jette"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"MW","start_time":[10,0,"Am"],"end_time":[10,50,"Am"]},"location":["SPH","1312"]}},{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"W","start_time":[2,0,"Pm"],"end_time":[2,50,"Pm"]},"location":["SPH","0305"]}}]},{"sec_code":"0103","instructors":["Shannon Jette"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"MW","start_time":[10,0,"Am"],"end_time":[10,50,"Am"]},"location":["SPH","1312"]}},{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"W","start_time":[3,0,"Pm"],"end_time":[3,50,"Pm"]},"location":["SPH","0305"]}}]},{"sec_code":"0104","instructors":["Shannon Jette"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"MW","start_time":[10,0,"Am"],"end_time":[10,50,"Am"]},"location":["SPH","1312"]}},{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"F","start_time":[10,0,"Am"],"end_time":[10,50,"Am"]},"location":["SPH","0305"]}}]},{"sec_code":"0105","instructors":["Shannon Jette"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"MW","start_time":[10,0,"Am"],"end_time":[10,50,"Am"]},"location":["SPH","1312"]}},{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"F","start_time":[11,0,"Am"],"end_time":[11,50,"Am"]},"location":["SPH","0305"]}}]},{"sec_code":"0106","instructors":["Shannon Jette"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"MW","start_time":[10,0,"Am"],"end_time":[10,50,"Am"]},"location":["SPH","1312"]}},{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"F","start_time":[12,0,"Pm"],"end_time":[12,50,"Pm"]},"location":["SPH","0305"]}}]}]},{"code":"KNES286","name":"Empowering Healthy Physical Activity","credits":{"Amount":3},"gen_eds":["DSSP"],"description":"Learn evidence-based techniques that health professionals use to promote physical activity programs that meet the needs of diverse populations.

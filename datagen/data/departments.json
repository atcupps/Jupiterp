Weather affects not just our daily activities but other important aspects of society such as transportation, commerce, security and agriculture. Most people understand what weather is to some extent. Climate and climate change are concepts that evoke strong emotional responses from people but are less well understood.

An article in the New York Times, in 2018, declared an \"Insect Apocalypse\" that for the first time brought the unexplained declines in insects to the public and suggested a catastrophe awaits our planet. Scientists have documented the loss of insect species at a rate exceeding the extinction rates associated with the major geological events in Earth's history. Based on science and research, students will be provided with background, and discover on their own, the diversity of the form and functions of insects, as well as how they evolved and persisted for 400 million years. The course, designed for students of any major, celebrates the incredible variation of insect life and what they do to support life on our planet. The course will highlight the use of scientific research to understand and respond to the global crisis.","sections":[{"sec_code":"0101","instructors":["Michael

The impact of each of these decisions flows through the three financial statements and results in financial outcomes and ratios that measure the success of each team.

The experience of solving business problems will both enable students to apply knowledge learned in core courses and to develop the wisdom, skills, and problem-solving capabilities of team members. This course is designed to promote independent learning. Faculty members will offer mini-modules on key themes such as team dynamics, client relations and consulting protocols but their primary role will be to facilitate the ALP process and serve as consultants to the student teams.Selecting the right project and defining it unambiguously sets the stage for the rest of the ALP process improvement or problem solving effort, ultimately leading to a relevant, value added and well-received deliverable. Poor problem selection creates longer-term problems for both ALP teams and the sponsoring organization and can reduce or impede the quality of your learning experience. For this reason, we will lay the foundation for the final selection of projects during this term (a) soliciting ideas from all students, and (b) offering feedback to identify and nurture the most promising ideas.","sections":[{"sec_code":"SO31","instructors":["Protiti Dastidar"],"class_meetings":[{"OnlineSync":{"days":"M","start_time":[6,30,"Pm"],"end_time":[8,0,"Pm"]}},"OnlineAsync"]},{"sec_code":"SO32","instructors":["Protiti Dastidar"],"class_meetings":[{"OnlineSync":{"days":"M","start_time":[8,15,"Am"],"end_time":[9,45,"Pm"]}},"OnlineAsync"]},{"sec_code":"SO33","instructors":["Neta Moye"],"class_meetings":[{"OnlineSync":{"days":"Tu","start_time":[6,30,"Pm"],"end_time":[8,0,"Pm"]}},"OnlineAsync"]}]},{"code":"BUSO706","name":"Organizational Change","credits":{"Amount":2},"gen_eds":null,"description":"Develops the advanced knowledge and skills of MBA students who plan to work with organizations as change agents.

Recently, steampunk has come to life in the scientific field of quantum thermodynamics. Thermodynamics, the study of energy, grew out of the Industrial Revolution. Two centuries later, quantum physics is transforming computing and cryptography. Quantum science is now revolutionizing 19th-century thermodynamics in quantum thermodynamics, which features quantum engines, automata, and more. Quantum thermodynamics inspired the growing subgenre of quantum steampunk.

These advances have enabled many people to do things they previously were incapable of but have also brought about a series of ethical questions around their development and use. These developments raise fundamental questions around whether it is even possible to develop generative AI technology that empowers rather than replaces people, and which serves human values such as rights, justice, and dignity.

While we humans perceive the world by looking, listening, touching, smelling, and tasting, tradit form of machine intelligence has primarily focused on a single sensory modality, often vision. To truly understand the world around us, AI must learn to jointly interpret multimodal signals. This graduate-level seminar course explores computer vision from a multimodal perspective, focusing on learning algorithms that augment vision with other essentiamodalities, such as audio, touch, language, and more. The majority of the course will consist of student presentations, experiments, and paper discussions, and we will delve into the latest research and advancements in multimodal perception.","sections":[{"sec_code":"0101","instructors":["Ruohan Gao"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"Tu","start_time":[3,30,"Pm"],"end_time":[6,0,"Pm"]},"location":["CSI","2120"]}}]},{"sec_code":"PJ01","instructors":["Ruohan Gao"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"Tu","start_time":[3,30,"Pm"],"end_time":[6,0,"Pm"]},"location":["CSI","2120"]}}]}]},{"code":"CMSC848O","name":"Selected Topics in Information Processing; Long-Context Language Models","credits":{"Amount":3},"gen_eds":null,"description":"Restriction: Must be in the Computer Science Master's or Doctoral programs, or permission of instructor.<br><br> Focuses on recent developments in training, aligning, and evaluating long-context language models, which have allowed cutting-edge LLMs to process and generate millions of words.

You will explore emerging social, political, legal, cultural, and social justice issues associated with the building and maintenance of infrastructure from the perspective of Science and Technology Studies (STS) and engineers. You will work with a volunteer corps of professional engineers from a variety of disciplines on a service-learning project designed to assess the safety and vitality of infrastructure.","sections":[{"sec_code":"0101","instructors":["Instructor: TBA"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"TuTh","start_time":[11,0,"Am"],"end_time":[12,15,"Pm"]},"location":["CCC","1200"]}}]}]}]},{"name":"DANC","courses":[{"code":"DANC109","name":"Choreography I: Improvisation","credits":{"Amount":3},"gen_eds":null,"description":"Students must pay a $25.00 lab fee.","sections":[{"sec_code":"5501","instructors":["Sara Pearson"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"TuTh","start_time":[11,0,"Am"],"end_time":[12,15,"Pm"]},"location":["PAC","1912"]}},"OnlineAsync"]}]},{"code":"DANC128","name":"Fundamentals of Ballet","credits":{"Amount":2},"gen_eds":null,"description":"Students must pay a $25.00 lab fee.","sections":[{"sec_code":"5501","instructors":["Instructor: TBA"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"TuTh","start_time":[9,30,"Am"],"end_time":[10,45,"Am"]},"location":["PAC","1908"]}},"OnlineAsync"]}]},{"code":"DANC138A","name":"Global Dance Forms;

We will see how our own species came to be, and of our spread across the world from our ancestral home in Africa. We'll examine how the fossil record contains evidence of climate changes and extinction events far exceeding what we are currently experiencing, and how we can use these as warnings for our future. We'll address who are the owners and stakeholders in the evidence of the fossil world. Students will learn how to read and interpret the primary scientific literature, and how to present scientific information to others through various media.","sections":[{"sec_code":"0101","instructors":["Thomas Holtz"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"TuTh","start_time":[9,30,"Am"],"end_time":[10,45,"Am"]},"location":["TWS","0320"]}},{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"M","start_time":[3,0,"Pm"],"end_time":[3,50,"Pm"]},"location":["ATL","1106"]}}]},{"sec_code":"0102","instructors":["Thomas Holtz"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"TuTh","start_time":[9,30,"Am"],"end_time":[10,45,"Am"]},"location":["TWS","0320"]}},{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"M","start_time":[4,0,"Pm"],"end_time":[4,50,"Pm"]},"location":["ATL","1106"]}}]},{"sec_code":"0103","instructors":["Thomas Holtz"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"TuTh","start_time":[9,30,"Am"],"end_time":[10,45,"Am"]},"location":["TWS","0320"]}},{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"M","start_time":[5,0,"Pm"],"end_time":[5,50,"Pm"]},"location":["ATL","1106"]}}]},{"sec_code":"0104","instructors":["Thomas Holtz"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"TuTh","start_time":[9,30,"Am"],"end_time":[10,45,"Am"]},"location":["TWS","0320"]}},{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"M","start_time":[3,0,"Pm"],"end_time":[3,50,"Pm"]},"location":["ATL","0201"]}}]},{"sec_code":"0105","instructors":["Thomas Holtz"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"TuTh","start_time":[9,30,"Am"],"end_time":[10,45,"Am"]},"location":["TWS","0320"]}},{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"M","start_time":[4,0,"Pm"],"end_time":[4,50,"Pm"]},"location":["ATL","0201"]}}]},{"sec_code":"0106","instructors":["Thomas Holtz"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"TuTh","start_time":[9,30,"Am"],"end_time":[10,45,"Am"]},"location":["TWS","0320"]}},{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"M","start_time":[5,0,"Pm"],"end_time":[5,50,"Pm"]},"location":["ATL","0201"]}}]}]},{"code":"GEOL322","name":"Mineralogy","credits":{"Amount":4},"gen_eds":null,"description":"Basic mineralogy for geology majors.

Yet the U.S.-China relationship is at times turbulent, and its future remains highly uncertain. Will the U.S. and China be able to forge a closer partnership that will enable them to cooperate in dealing with some of the vexing challenges facing the international community?  Or are they more likely to drift toward a more adversarial relationship, as China's growing power--and the US reaction--generate a vicious cycle of mutual mistrust?

Thus there are many opportunities for difficulties with language, which is the focus of our field. Understanding difficulties with speech, language, and hearing require first understanding how processing works when language is successful - the psychological (behavioral) and neurobiological (brain) factors that enable people to learn and use language despite its intricacies, the structure and properties of language itself, and how knowledge of language is acquired, represented, and processed in the mind and brain.","sections":[{"sec_code":"PDH1","instructors":["Manaar Zuhurudeen"],"class_meetings":[{"OnlineSync":{"days":"Tu","start_time":[6,30,"Pm"],"end_time":[9,0,"Pm"]}}]}]},{"code":"HESP202","name":"Introduction to Hearing and Speech Sciences","credits":{"Amount":3},"gen_eds":null,"description":"An introduction to communication sciences and disorders; a survey of the bases of normal speech, language and hearing ability, major forms of communicative disorders and their treatment.","sections":[{"sec_code":"0101","instructors":["Christina Shields","Sarah Zsak"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"TuTh","start_time":[9,30,"Am"],"end_time":[10,45,"Am"]},"location":["ESJ","1202"]}}]}]},{"code":"HESP214","name":"The Research Behind Headlines on Words, Thought, and Behavior","credits":{"Amount":3},"gen_eds":["DSHS","SCIS"],"description":"How does the human mind use language?

This was the first such declaration of independence ever issued, but its ideas and forms traveled far and wide. More than 100 other declarations of independence have been issued since then.

Through discussions and hands-on activities, you will learn the social value of showing up, for the world and for yourself. This course is self-contained but paired with HNUH269P in the Building Community track, where you will learn the science of connection and apply these skills to build more meaningful relationships in your life.","sections":[{"sec_code":"0101","instructors":["James Stillwell"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"TuTh","start_time":[3,30,"Pm"],"end_time":[4,45,"Pm"]},"location":["HBK","0125"]}}]}]},{"code":"HNUH278B","name":"Democratic Habits","credits":{"Amount":3},"gen_eds":["DSHU","SCIS"],"description":"How do ordinary citizens power democracy? At the age of 18, every American citizen is endowed with the right to vote, but what if democracy demands more than voting?  With democratic processes seemingly in peril all around us, what can and should ordinary citizens do to safeguard democracy? Looking beyond the basic right to vote, this class will instead explore the complex ecosystem of citizenship practices necessary for collective self-governance. Turning to both philosophy and history, the course material addresses the power and peril of such civic habits as mutual aid, economic participation, tolerance, attention, organizing, protest, and more. We consider what resources these habits require, what virtues they inspire, and what happens when they conflict with each other.

Human expansion into new ecosystems also provided opportunities for us to acquire new pathogens. While all of human history is marked by diseases caused by human migration, the Industrial Revolution greatly accelerated human mobility while planting the seeds of the human impact on climate change. Today, the increasingly rapid movement of people and goods, combined with a warming planet and the large-scale disruption of major ecosystems has witnessed an unprecedented spread of infectious diseases.

These conditions would need to address injustices such as the racism, gender inequalities, marginalization, and colonization that produce disparities in reproductive health care and jeopardize the well-being of individuals, families, communities, and countries.

This class examines scandals in politics, science, religion, social media, business, government, sports, and higher education; feeding frenzies, tabloid scandalmongering, undercover reporting, apologies, and cancel culture. Learn why even trivial scandals matter--and how scandals reflect what we value and ultimately who we are.","sections":[{"sec_code":"0101","instructors":["Mark Feldstein"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"TuTh","start_time":[11,0,"Am"],"end_time":[12,15,"Pm"]},"location":["KNI","1208"]}}]}]},{"code":"JOUR289I","name":"Information 3.0: Exploring Technological Tools","credits":{"Amount":3},"gen_eds":["DSSP","SCIS"],"description":"Students will expand their understanding of various digital information and the issues it raises, evaluate media research investigating how users interact with information for different purposes, analyze how diverse audiences seek, select, share and produce various types of digital information, and evaluate the ethics related to digital privacy and security.","sections":[{"sec_code":"0101","instructors":["Ronald Yaros"],"class_meetings":[{"OnlineSync":{"days":"Tu","start_time":[11,0,"Am"],"end_time":[12,15,"Pm"]}},"OnlineAsync"]}]},{"code":"JOUR320","name":"News Writing and Reporting II: Multiplatform","credits":{"Amount":3},"gen_eds":null,"description":"Principles and practices of news reporting; covering news beats and other news sources, including researching news stories for accuracy, comprehensiveness and interpretation.

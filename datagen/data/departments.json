The field of science communication ventures that the answer is not simply a matter of improving capacity (e.g., because people lack scientific information, scientists lack communication skills, or both). Rather, it calls for sustained collaboration and empathy between laypersons and experts. In this hands-on, experiential course, we use a model of cultural competency to put forth solutions to bridge the expert-lay divide. We investigate typical venues in which science is communicated (museums, YouTube videos, federal agency websites, and much much more) and study best practices for communication. Then we explore emerging venues that support sustained contact between so-called \"lay citizens\" and scientific or technical experts (dance/improv techniques, ethnographic methods and citizen science).

As the population increases and the number of large urban areas keeps growing (both in U.S. and internationally), managing water in urban areas is becoming more challenging. Water must be supplied for domestic, commercial, and industrial use, as well as irrigation and maintaining and enhancing local environments (e.g., urban streams). In addition, stormwater must be managed to prevent flooding and environmental damage, and used water, which contains organic matter, nutrients, and other constituents that can be extracted and reused, must be collected and managed.

In the last generation, however, events like the Iranian Revolution, the rise of the Christian Right, 9/11, the Tibetan monks protest, the spread of Truth and Reconciliation Commissions, and numerous wars fought in the name of God have brought religion back to prominence in world affairs.

This course is designed to survey the promise and the challenges of foreign aid as a policy tool. The first half of the course will focus on the motivations and goals of foreign aid. We will consider various foreign aid donors, such as countries, institutions, and individuals, to understand the motivations behind and effects of foreign aid.

Thus there are many opportunities for difficulties with language, which is the focus of our field. Understanding difficulties with speech, language, and hearing require first understanding how processing works when language is successful - the psychological (behavioral) and neurobiological (brain) factors that enable people to learn and use language despite its intricacies, the structure and properties of language itself, and how knowledge of language is acquired, represented, and processed in the mind and brain.","sections":[{"sec_code":"PBH1","instructors":["Fathima Zuhurudeen"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"Tu","start_time":[6,30,"Pm"],"end_time":[9,0,"Pm"]},"location":["TWS","1107"]}}]}]},{"code":"HESP202","name":"Introduction to Hearing and Speech Sciences","credits":{"Amount":3},"gen_eds":null,"description":"An introduction to communication sciences and disorders; a survey of the bases of normal speech, language and hearing ability, major forms of communicative disorders and their treatment.","sections":[{"sec_code":"0101","instructors":["Sarah Zsak","Christina Shields"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"TuTh","start_time":[9,30,"Am"],"end_time":[10,45,"Am"]},"location":["TWS","0320"]}}]}]},{"code":"HESP214","name":"The Research Behind Headlines on Words, Thought, and Behavior","credits":{"Amount":3},"gen_eds":["DSHS","SCIS"],"description":"How does the human mind use language?

This course will explore the relationship among memory, the body and the built environment. Beginning with the role cities play in our individual lives and the construction of personal memories, we will take account of what we forget by remembering and what experiences are missing. Through lectures, seminars and discussions, students will produce short experimental books and pamphlets remapping Washington D.C. and the many invisible - personal - cities it contains.

Today, over 70 million people are displaced from their homelands. Using films as well as readings by leading African scholars, students will consider the depth and scope of migration and displacement. Among the key questions we will explore are: How does migration affect the storytelling of African filmmakers?

We tend to assume that we should know how to connect with others intuitively, but, as rising rates of loneliness indicate, this is not the case: connection is something we must learn and practice.

Against this background, this course discusses advanced ML concepts such as cross validation, class imbalance, Boosting and Stacking as well as key approaches for facilitating model tuning and performing feature selection.  In this course we also introduce additional machine learning methods including Support Vector Machines, Extra-Trees and LASSO among others. The course aims to illustrate these concepts, methods and approaches from a social science perspective. Furthermore, the course covers techniques for extracting patterns from unstructured data as well as interpreting and presenting results from machine learning algorithms.

We consider how Asian American femininities/masculinities are conceived and circulated, drawing from a diverse selection of twentieth-century and contemporary texts, films and images that connect Asian American bodies to ideas of absence, danger, inscrutability, hyper- or hypo-sexuality, and virulence. Beginning with early to mid-twentieth century representations, the course attends to theories that clarify the contested relationship between the East/West and Asia/U.S. Also examined are the methods through which bodies differentiated by sex, gender, and race are managed, surveilled, and rehabilitated, with close attention to the enduring legacies of American expansionism and conquest, anti-immigration policies in the U.S., and twentieth-century wars and occupations in Asia. The course engages Women of Color feminisms, queer theory, and disability studies.","sections":[{"sec_code":"0101","instructors":["Jennifer Cho"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"TuTh","start_time":[11,0,"Am"],"end_time":[12,15,"Pm"]},"location":["TWS","1107"]}}]}]},{"code":"WGSS498Y","name":"Advanced Special Topics in Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies; Dickinson, Erotics, Poetics, Biopics: Some (Queer) Ways We Read Poetry","credits":{"Amount":3},"gen_eds":null,"description":"Prerequisite: two English courses in literature or permission of department.

As well as being the ultimate laboratory for studying the nature of space and time, they drive some of the most energetic and extreme phenomena known to astronomers (with quasars and gamma-ray bursts being just a couple of examples).  In this introduction to the physics and astrophysics of black holes, we start by examining the basic physics of black holes, which fundamentally means understanding gravity.  We then look at the nature of stellar-mass black holes and supermassive black holes.  We will discuss the fairly recent realization that black holes may be crucial agents for regulating the growth of galaxies.  Finally, we dive into the realm of theoretical physics and probe how black holes may provide a route for uncovering new laws of physics governing the structure of space and time.","sections":[{"sec_code":"0101","instructors":["Richard Mushotzky"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"MW","start_time":[2,0,"Pm"],"end_time":[3,15,"Pm"]},"location":["ATL","2400"]}}]}]},{"code":"ASTR380","name":"Life in the Universe - Astrobiology","credits":{"Amount":3},"gen_eds":["DSNS"],"conditions":null,"description":"Designed primarily for non-science majors.

Recently, steampunk has come to life in the scientific field of quantum thermodynamics. Thermodynamics, the study of energy, grew out of the Industrial Revolution. Two centuries later, quantum physics is transforming computing and cryptography. Quantum science is now revolutionizing 19th-century thermodynamics in quantum thermodynamics, which features quantum engines, automata, and more. Quantum thermodynamics inspired the growing subgenre of quantum steampunk. In this course, you will read science fiction, write quantum-steampunk short stories, receive feedback, and critique classmates writing. In parallel, you will learn QUANTUM STEAMPUNK WRKSHPechnologies, and thermodynamics.","sections":[{"sec_code":"0101","instructors":["Nicole Yunger Halpern","Edward Daschle"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"MW","start_time":[3,30,"Pm"],"end_time":[4,45,"Pm"]},"location":["ATL","0201"]}}]},{"sec_code":"0102","instructors":["Nicole Yunger Halpern","Edward Daschle"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"MW","start_time":[3,30,"Pm"],"end_time":[4,45,"Pm"]},"location":["ATL","0201"]}}]}]},{"code":"CHEM316","name":"Chemical Demonstrations and Outreach","credits":{"Amount":1},"gen_eds":null,"conditions":["Prerequisite: (CHEM241 and CHEM242) or CHEM247; and (CHEM271 or CHEM276) and (CHEM272 or CHEM277).

This course will examine how these various ideologies have evolved throughout the 20th and 21st century, impacting the ways in which heroes and villains are both represented in American film and perceived by diverse audiences.

As computational processes shape ever more dimensions of everyday life from the personal to the global scale, understanding how they operate and how power operates within them grows ever more important. Combating racism and sexism is not as simple as ensuring the pool of programmers and engineers is more diverse; structures of power are embedded in digital technologies as they are in all aspects of our society, and we must learn to perceive their operation if we hope to transform them. We will examine how racism and sexism operate in the field of computer science and in everyday uses of digital technologies, while studying how feminist and racial justice movements have created alternative approaches.

Recently, steampunk has come to life in the scientific field of quantum thermodynamics. Thermodynamics, the study of energy, grew out of the Industrial Revolution. Two centuries later, quantum physics is transforming computing and cryptography. Quantum science is now revolutionizing 19th-century thermodynamics in quantum thermodynamics, which features quantum engines, automata, and more. Quantum thermodynamics inspired the growing subgenre of quantum steampunk. In this course, you will read science fiction, write quantum steampunk short stories, receive feedback, and critique classmates' writing. In parallel, you will learn about quantum physics, technologies, and thermodynamics.","sections":[{"sec_code":"0101","instructors":["Nicole Yunger Halpern","Edward Daschle"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"MW","start_time":[3,30,"Pm"],"end_time":[4,45,"Pm"]},"location":["ATL","0201"]}}]},{"sec_code":"0102","instructors":["Nicole Yunger Halpern","Edward Daschle"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"MW","start_time":[3,30,"Pm"],"end_time":[4,45,"Pm"]},"location":["ATL","0201"]}}]}]},{"code":"CMSC320","name":"Introduction to Data Science","credits":{"Amount":3},"gen_eds":null,"conditions":["Prerequisite: Minimum grade of C- in CMSC216 and CMSC250.

To truly understand the world around us, AI must learn to jointly interpret multimodal signals. This graduate-level seminar course explores computer vision from a multimodal perspective, focusing on learning algorithms that augment vision with other essentiamodalities, such as audio, touch, language, and more. The majority of the course will consist of student presentations, experiments, and paper discussions, and we will delve into the latest research and advancements in multimodal

We often take for granted the services infrastructure bring us. As a consequence, the United States, which at one time was a world leader in creating infrastructure, is experiencing an infrastructure crisis. Furthermore, not everyone experiences this issue equally. This course is designed to identify the root causes of the crisis. You will explore emerging social, political, legal, cultural, and social justice issues associated with the building and maintenance of infrastructure from the perspective of Science and Technology Studies (STS) and engineers. You will work with a volunteer corps of professional engineers from a variety of disciplines on a service-learning project designed to assess the safety and vitality of infrastructure.","sections":[{"sec_code":"0101","instructors":["Nicole Mogul"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"TuTh","start_time":[11,0,"Am"],"end_time":[12,15,"Pm"]},"location":["CBD","1140"]}}]}]}]},{"name":"DANC","courses":[{"code":"DANC109","name":"Choreography I: Improvisation","credits":{"Amount":3},"gen_eds":null,"conditions":null,"description":"Students must pay a $25.00 lab fee.","sections":[{"sec_code":"5501","instructors":["Sara Pearson"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"TuTh","start_time":[11,0,"Am"],"end_time":[12,15,"Pm"]},"location":["PAC","1912"]}},"OnlineAsync"]}]},{"code":"DANC128","name":"Fundamentals of Ballet","credits":{"Amount":2},"gen_eds":null,"conditions":null,"description":"Students must pay a $25.00 lab fee.","sections":[{"sec_code":"5501","instructors":["Emilia Bruno"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"TuTh","start_time":[9,30,"Am"],"end_time":[10,45,"Am"]},"location":["PAC","1912"]}},"OnlineAsync"]}]},{"code":"DANC138A","name":"Global Dance Forms; Musical Theatre Jazz","credits":{"Amount":2},"gen_eds":null,"conditions":null,"description":"Students must pay a $25 lab fee.","sections":[{"sec_code":"5501","instructors":["Milo Longenecker"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"TuTh","start_time":[2,0,"Pm"],"end_time":[3,15,"Pm"]},"location":["PAC","1908"]}},"OnlineAsync"]}]},{"code":"DANC138C","name":"Global Dance Forms; Pop Culture Dances &amp; TikTok","credits":{"Amount":2},"gen_eds":null,"conditions":null,"description":"","sections":[{"sec_code":"5501","instructors":["Connor Voss"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"TuTh","start_time":[2,0,"Pm"],"end_time":[3,15,"Pm"]},"location":["PAC","1912"]}},"OnlineAsync"]}]},{"code":"DANC138G","name":"Global Dance Forms; Improvisation in Dance","credits":{"Amount":2},"gen_eds":null,"conditions":null,"description":"","sections":[{"sec_code":"5501","instructors":["Zoe Walders"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"TuTh","start_time":[9,30,"Am"],"end_time":[10,45,"Am"]},"location":["PKT","2102"]}},"OnlineAsync"]}]},{"code":"DANC138P","name":"Global Dance Forms; Hip Hop: Bounce &amp; Rock","credits":{"Amount":2},"gen_eds":null,"conditions":null,"description":"","sections":[{"sec_code":"5501","instructors":["Ama Law"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"TuTh","start_time":[9,30,"Am"],"end_time":[10,45,"Am"]},"location":["PAC","1908"]}},"OnlineAsync"]}]},{"code":"DANC148","name":"Fundamentals of Modern Dance","credits":{"Amount":2},"gen_eds":null,"conditions":null,"description":"Students must pay a $25.00 lab fee.","sections":[{"sec_code":"5501","instructors":["Emilia Bruno"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"TuTh","start_time":[11,0,"Am"],"end_time":[12,15,"Pm"]},"location":["PAC","1611"]}},"OnlineAsync"]}]},{"code":"DANC149","name":"Fundamentals of Modern Dance II","credits":{"Amount":2},"gen_eds":null,"conditions":null,"description":"","sections":[{"sec_code":"5501","instructors":["Jamie Chen"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"TuTh","start_time":[9,30,"Am"],"end_time":[10,45,"Am"]},"location":["PAC","1611"]}},"OnlineAsync"]}]},{"code":"DANC200","name":"Introduction to Dance","credits":{"Amount":3},"gen_eds":["DSSP"],"conditions":null,"description":"A study of dance as a form of communication and as an art form; a survey of the theories and styles of dance, and their relationships to other art forms.","sections":[{"sec_code":"0101","instructors":["Madeline Warriner"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"TuTh","start_time":[2,0,"Pm"],"end_time":[3,15,"Pm"]},"location":["TWS","0236"]}}]},{"sec_code":"0201","instructors":["Taylor Knight"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"TuTh","start_time":[12,30,"Pm"],"end_time":[1,45,"Pm"]},"location":["PAC","1809"]}}]},{"sec_code":"0301","instructors":["Kevin Carroll"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"TuTh","start_time":[11,0,"Am"],"end_time":[12,15,"Pm"]},"location":["JMZ","2120"]}}]}]},{"code":"DANC207","name":"Choreography II: The Creative Process","credits":{"Amount":3},"gen_eds":null,"conditions":["Prerequisite: DANC109.

First, its objective is to understand the role of financial markets for fluctuations in the macroeconomy. More specifically, starting from a complete markets benchmark, we study canonical types of credit market frictions that give rise to macroeconomic effects. Second, the course aims to enhance the students' toolkit to carry out state-of-the-art research in macroeconomics in general. It provides plenty of practical exercise to take models (usually DSGE models with financial frictions) to the computer. Third, alongside the methodological content, we revisit empirical facts on the regularities of financial variables, the 2008-09 global financial crisis and the Covid-19 recession.","sections":[{"sec_code":"0101","instructors":["Thomas Drechsel"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"Tu","start_time":[2,30,"Pm"],"end_time":[5,0,"Pm"]},"location":["TYD","0102"]}}]}]},{"code":"ECON756","name":"Empirical Political Economics","credits":{"Amount":3},"gen_eds":null,"conditions":null,"description":"An introduction to empirical political economy.

Students will learn about the history of representing other-than-human actors in the world--including Indigenous ways of knowing--and how this history can help us envision new, shared relationships with the natural world.","sections":[{"sec_code":"0101","instructors":["Kellie Robertson"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"MW","start_time":[1,0,"Pm"],"end_time":[1,50,"Pm"]},"location":["PLS","1140"]}},{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"F","start_time":[11,0,"Am"],"end_time":[11,50,"Am"]},"location":["TWS","0207"]}}]},{"sec_code":"0102","instructors":["Kellie Robertson"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"MW","start_time":[1,0,"Pm"],"end_time":[1,50,"Pm"]},"location":["PLS","1140"]}},{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"F","start_time":[12,0,"Pm"],"end_time":[12,50,"Pm"]},"location":["TWS","0207"]}}]},{"sec_code":"0103","instructors":["Kellie Robertson"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"MW","start_time":[1,0,"Pm"],"end_time":[1,50,"Pm"]},"location":["PLS","1140"]}},{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"F","start_time":[1,0,"Pm"],"end_time":[1,50,"Pm"]},"location":["TWS","0207"]}}]},{"sec_code":"0104","instructors":["Kellie Robertson"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"MW","start_time":[1,0,"Pm"],"end_time":[1,50,"Pm"]},"location":["PLS","1140"]}},{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"F","start_time":[2,0,"Pm"],"end_time":[2,50,"Pm"]},"location":["TWS","0207"]}}]}]},{"code":"ENGL140","name":"American Fictions: U.S. Literature, History, Politics, and Constitutional Law","credits":{"Amount":3},"gen_eds":["DSHU","SCIS"],"conditions":null,"description":"Works of American literature explored in the context of major texts and developments of U.S. history, culture, politics, and constitutional law.

Recently, steampunk has come to life in the scientific field of quantum thermodynamics. Thermodynamics, the study of energy, grew out of the Industrial Revolution. Two centuries later, quantum physics is transforming computing and cryptography. Quantum science is now revolutionizing 19th-century thermodynamics in quantum thermodynamics, which features quantum engines, automata, and more. Quantum thermodynamics inspired the growing subgenre of quantum steampunk. In this course, you will read science fiction, write quantum steampunk short stories, receive feedback, and critique classmates' writing. In parallel, you will learn about quantum physics, technologies, and thermodynamics.","sections":[{"sec_code":"0101","instructors":["Nicole Yunger Halpern","Edward Daschle"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"MW","start_time":[3,30,"Pm"],"end_time":[4,45,"Pm"]},"location":["ATL","0201"]}}]},{"sec_code":"0102","instructors":["Nicole Yunger Halpern","Edward Daschle"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"MW","start_time":[3,30,"Pm"],"end_time":[4,45,"Pm"]},"location":["ATL","0201"]}}]}]},{"code":"ENME331","name":"Fluid Mechanics","credits":{"Amount":3},"gen_eds":null,"conditions":["Prerequisite: ENES232 and ENES221.

Yet the U.S.-China relationship is at times turbulent, and its future remains highly uncertain. Will the U.S. and China be able to forge a closer partnership that will enable them to cooperate in dealing with some of the vexing challenges facing the international community?  Or are they more likely to drift toward a more adversarial relationship, as China's growing power--and the US reaction--generate a vicious cycle of mutual mistrust?

Students will collaborate with local artists, contemporary and diverse art collections at UMD, other local galleries, and recent community-based art projects to understand the real-world impact the arts can have on social transformation. The main engagement of this course will be to co-design and implement a community-based art project together with the community it will impact.

A traditional debate concerns whether language is a unique human faculty. While communication systems are common - cetaceans whistle and sing, songbirds and parrots are vocal learners, bees convey information about energy sources - the specific properties of human language, involving finite mental means to socially yield unbounded messages, have not been easy to find in other species. This course delves into the question of whether this quality is unique to humans. The only precondition to take it is the willingness to approach the matter scientifically, starting with notions from a Computational Theory of Mind. Students may bring to bear upon these questions insights from linguistics, psychology, neuroscience, molecular biology, etc., to debate how an abstract systematic behavior can arise within an animal brain, and what that says about evolution.","sections":[{"sec_code":"0101","instructors":["Juan Uriagereka"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"MW","start_time":[2,0,"Pm"],"end_time":[3,15,"Pm"]},"location":["JMZ","0122"]}}]}]},{"code":"LING311","name":"Syntax I","credits":{"Amount":3},"gen_eds":null,"conditions":["Prerequisite: LING240."],"description":"Basic concepts, analytical techniques of generative syntax, relation to empirical limits imposed by viewing grammars as representations of a component of human mind.

Philosophy will provide the primary disciplinary context, but we will also think about sociological, legal and anthropological perspectives on sports. Issues will include the nature of sportsmanship, what types of violence in sports are acceptable, drug use in sports, what it means to be a fan (for example, asking why loyalty to your team is valuable) and how our view of sports interacts with our view of nations. By the end of the course you should have gained familiarity with a variety of ethical concepts and a sensitivity to the ethical issues in sports. You should also find that by thinking about morality in the context of sports, you will look at larger ethical issues in new ways.","sections":[{"sec_code":"0101","instructors":["Harjit Bhogal"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"MW","start_time":[11,0,"Am"],"end_time":[11,50,"Am"]},"location":["ESJ","1202"]}},{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"F","start_time":[10,0,"Am"],"end_time":[10,50,"Am"]},"location":["TWS","0234"]}}]},{"sec_code":"0102","instructors":["Harjit Bhogal"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"MW","start_time":[11,0,"Am"],"end_time":[11,50,"Am"]},"location":["ESJ","1202"]}},{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"F","start_time":[11,0,"Am"],"end_time":[11,50,"Am"]},"location":["TWS","0234"]}}]},{"sec_code":"0103","instructors":["Harjit Bhogal"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"MW","start_time":[11,0,"Am"],"end_time":[11,50,"Am"]},"location":["ESJ","1202"]}},{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"F","start_time":[1,0,"Pm"],"end_time":[1,50,"Pm"]},"location":["SKN","1112"]}}]},{"sec_code":"0104","instructors":["Harjit Bhogal"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"MW","start_time":[11,0,"Am"],"end_time":[11,50,"Am"]},"location":["ESJ","1202"]}},{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"F","start_time":[10,0,"Am"],"end_time":[10,50,"Am"]},"location":["KEY","0102"]}}]},{"sec_code":"0105","instructors":["Harjit Bhogal"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"MW","start_time":[11,0,"Am"],"end_time":[11,50,"Am"]},"location":["ESJ","1202"]}},{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"F","start_time":[11,0,"Am"],"end_time":[11,50,"Am"]},"location":["KEY","0102"]}}]},{"sec_code":"0106","instructors":["Harjit Bhogal"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"MW","start_time":[11,0,"Am"],"end_time":[11,50,"Am"]},"location":["ESJ","1202"]}},{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"F","start_time":[1,0,"Pm"],"end_time":[1,50,"Pm"]},"location":["SKN","1115"]}}]}]},{"code":"PHIL211","name":"AI &amp; ETHICS","credits":{"Amount":3},"gen_eds":["DSSP"],"conditions":["Credit only granted for: PHIL209D or PHIL211.

The course closes with an examination of fat liberation as liberation for all bodies with a particular emphasis on performing arts and activism as a vehicle for liberation and challenging fatmisia.","sections":[{"sec_code":"0101","instructors":["Sydney Lewis"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"MW","start_time":[2,0,"Pm"],"end_time":[3,15,"Pm"]},"location":["SQH","4116"]}}]}]},{"code":"WGSS319P","name":"Workshops in Gender, Race, and Queer Studies; Pleasure, Intimacy, and Violence","credits":{"Amount":3},"gen_eds":null,"conditions":null,"description":"","sections":[{"sec_code":"0101","instructors":["Zenzele Isoke"],"class_meetings":[{"InPerson":{"classtime":{"days":"TuTh","start_time":[2,0,"Pm"],"end_time":[3,15,"Pm"]},"location":["SQH","1101"]}}]}]},{"code":"WGSS320","name":"Women in Classical Antiquity","credits":{"Amount":3},"gen_eds":["DSHU","DVUP"],"conditions":["Cross-listed with: CLAS320, HIST328W.

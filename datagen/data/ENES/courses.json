At the same time, we are coming to appreciate the increasingly complex nature of technological systems as they become integrated into all forms of infrastructure, we realize they may be unpredictable, interdependent on social and biological systems, and have unintended consequences. In this midst of this complexity, people make decisions with far reaching impacts. How then do we follow our passion for technology and innovation but also stay skeptical in a way that allows us to consider the potential and shortcomings of technology?

There will be a mix of formal lectures by course faculty and lectures by distinguished speakers who can provide their own experience of what leadership means and how it is acquired.  Students will explore their own leadership philosophy and leadership capacities in the context of group practice. Students will make meaning of general leadership theories and concepts and understand how to apply them to engineering industry.  Students will also gain understanding of leadership through the stories shared by distinguished speakers with industrial, governmental and academic experience.",

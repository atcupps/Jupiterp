The course will cover major topics in Machine Learningsuch as supervised learning (i.e., regression, classification), unsupervised learning, deep learning, dimensionality reduction, and model selection and boosting. This course is packed with practical machine learning exercises that arebased on real-life examples. Studentswill learn machine learning theory, but they will also get hands-on practice building their models using programming tools such as Python and R.",

The course covers the distinctions between scientific and other writing styles, persuasive and factual writing, storytelling, and scientific grammar. Students learn to craft clear and concise sentences, structure their work logically, formulate hypotheses, and communicate science to both scientific and lay audiences. Through hands-on practice,feedback, and expert guidance, the goal is to enhance scientific writing abilities for publishing, presentations, and science communication.",

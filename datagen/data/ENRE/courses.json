      "description": "This course provides a general survey of the techniques of reliability engineering with a focus on quantitative methods. Topics covered include: failure modes and effects analysis, mathematical definition of reliability, probabilistic models to represent failure phenomena, statistical life models for non-repairable components, reliability data analysis, and system reliability models including fault trees, event trees.  Students will learn how to apply these techniques to problems related to engineering systems, with example cases for process plants, energy systems and infrastructure.",

The course teaches nonparametric and parametric statistical procedures of reliability data analysis for both non-repairable and repairable systems.  It covers test data analysis (including accelerated and degradation testing),  field data analysis (including warranty data and connected fleets data).  Machine learning methods in reliability data analysis are discussed as well, along with special topics on condition-based maintenance and prognostics.",

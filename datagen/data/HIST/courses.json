We will pay particular attention to how hierarchical inequalities are institutionalized, experienced, and represented and to how different marginalized and dominant groups interacted. Enslaved persons performed necessary labor in Greece and Rome and their work was essential for the formation of ancient society in agriculture, mining, domestic spaces, literature, finance, and government. Studying ancient slavery offers a chance to examine Greece and Rome from the bottom up, parsing the scant literary and material evidence for the lives and struggles of enslaved persons. We will practice several different approaches in order to tease out the systematic, economic, political, and personal effects of slavery in the ancient world. The United States of America was also founded as a slave society, and discussions of slavery in the Americas often look back to the ancient Mediterranean. The course will therefore conclude with a unit on how enslavers and abolitionists in the United States utilized and responded to slavery in antiquity.",

The course will look at the historical events and processes that have led to the emergence of such social structures that are more often the product of modern politics than markers of essential historical difference. We will analyze the roots of ethnic and religious diversity and their manipulation by colonial and post-colonial governments, and at the politics of self-assertion by minority groups in the Middle East and North Africa during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.",

What role does film, TV, music, fashion, and literature play ingiving a voice to working class and youth culture? We'll also incorporate 21st century pop culture (for example, costume dramas like \"Downton Abbey\" and \"Peaky Blinders\") to \"look back\" at this history and how we romanticize the past. How do programs like \"The Great British Bake-Off\" and Roy alevents from weddings, births, and funerals keep nostalgia for the monarchy alive, while also recognizing the nation's evolution as a multiracial, democratic society? How does British popular culture address notions of identity and what it means to be \"British\" in the 20th-21st centuries?",

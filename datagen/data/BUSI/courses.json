Particular focus will be placed on the critical collaboration needed between business leaders and IT leaders in the early stages of program definition and how to effectively leverage and assess business-driven enterprise, product, and program development. The course will cover contemporary product lifecycle phases and the systems engineering technical processes associated with research and product development organizations in industry and government.  It will explore currently popular development methodologies such as incremental, spiral, evolutionary, lean, and agile and how these are driven by concept and requirements development, systems analysis and modeling, and system architecting and are measured by technology prototyping, research validation, technology testing, and program/product evaluation.  The intent is exposure to the systems engineering processes and product/program lifecycle is to help technology management professionals align developmental efforts to business/mission strategy; help them to oversee, collaborate with, and evaluate technology development efforts; and help them navigate challenges of technology development and adoption and advance technologies more efficiently from concept to operational use.",

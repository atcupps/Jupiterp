The course will begin with a theoretical foundation of environmental justice, and the historical, social and economic roots of environmental injustices and environmental racism. We will explore the different contexts within which environmental injustice manifests itself including domestic and international examples such as injustices in the food system, climate justice, environmental privilege, and urban environmental justice and pollution. We will study the ways in which people and communities have combated environmental injustices by looking at the history of the environmental justice movement, which was created to address the increasingly disproportionate impacts of environmental harms on low income populations and communities of color.",

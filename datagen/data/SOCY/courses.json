We focus on conceptualizing human behavior as an interplay between both nature and nurture, and consider how this approach changes our understanding of modern social problems. This course is appropriate for students with a range of backgrounds in the social and natural sciences; introductory-level supplemental readings on all necessary biological concepts will be provided.",

      "description": "The 21st century has brought dramatic changes to the working class in the United States. Today's workers face a very different economy, politics, demography, and culture than the working class of the mid-20th century. This course will review these changes; contrast them with the position of the American middle class; explore gender, racial, and geographic differences within these changes; and look to possible futures ahead.",

It focuses on four key issues: how markets and the pursuit of profit came to organize virtually all aspects of material life and restructured societies around social classes; how democratic forms of governance emerged to direct states and the persistent challenges presented by authoritarian rule; how social revolution erupts and what kinds of changes it yields; and how warfare between states can produce varieties of change not necessarily comprehended in the foregoing domains.",

The course will rely heavily on the idea that you must know yourself first before you explore how \"you\" fit into the organization and how that organization fits into a broader context such as nation, culture, or community. We will talk about the social constructs of leadership and gender, including systems and structures, and the role media, television, movies, and sports play in defining women and their leadership in a cultural context. The exploration of women leaders will be broad based including the role that gender identity and expression, race, sexual orientation, country of origin, and ethnicity/culture play in women's definition and the expression of their leadership.",

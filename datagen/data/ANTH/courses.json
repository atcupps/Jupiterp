      "description": "An introduction to anthropological perspectives on non-normative genders and sexualities in transnational context. The focus on these identities and practices will involve ethnographic and theoretical examinations of how power and control are exerted on gender and sexuality in addition to how individuals and communities respond.  The ways in which sexuality and gender intersect with class, nation, and race will be examined along with the effects of globalization, transnational mass media, as well as cross-border economies and activisms on local or \"traditional\" genders and sexualities. Ethnography will be used to illuminate important cultural and national differences between people and thus unsettle North Atlantic-centric approaches to gender, sexuality, and queer studies.",

It focuses on the use of lasers to calculate 3-D measurements at various scales, from objects, to buildings, and landscapes. It will cover data management and archiving, field documentation processes, and post-processing of scan point clouds. This includes the production of deliverables for clients or project partners, such as plans, elevations, orthoimagery, and cleaned exported point clouds in formats that are compatible with Autodesk software and other CAD or rendering software platforms. This course is intended for students working in fields that rely on accurately documenting components of the built environment in three dimension, including architects, engineers, preservationists, archaeologists, or digital designers.",

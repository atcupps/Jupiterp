      "description": "PEER 322 is a three-credit, interdisciplinary course building upon the sexual assault, relationship violence, stalking, bystander intervention, and wellness knowledge gained during PEER 312.  Students will gain a fundamental understanding of program planning basics through a series of assignments where they theoretically plan their own prevention or awareness program for the University of Maryland campus community.  Students who become a Peer Leader during year two may have the opportunity to implement this program on campus.  This course also provides advanced training in the skills necessary to serve as an effective Peer Educator under the University Health Center.  Peer Educators will continue to provide outreach and education to the campus community through various outreach events, workshops, and more.",

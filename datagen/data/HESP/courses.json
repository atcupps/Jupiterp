      "description": "Language science is the scientific study of how humans acquire, use, comprehend, and produce language.  Most people in all societies learn and use their native language or languages with apparent ease - but don't be fooled: languages are highly complex, and speaking and understanding language requires some amazing feats of mental acrobatics. Thus there are many opportunities for difficulties with language, which is the focus of our field. Understanding difficulties with speech, language, and hearing require first understanding how processing works when language is successful - the psychological (behavioral) and neurobiological (brain) factors that enable people to learn and use language despite its intricacies, the structure and properties of language itself, and how knowledge of language is acquired, represented, and processed in the mind and brain.",

It depends what language you speak\" and \"Science's English dominance hinders diversity\" invite you to think about the impact of words on thought and behavior. These are stories about how humans acquire and use language, but they ultimately address big questions about how we experience knowledge itself. In a world of unprecedented access to science journalism, did you ever read a headline about human behavior and wonder: How do we know? This class takes up the elegant ways cognitive scientists design experiments to answer crucial questions about language and thought, brain and behavior, that have no intuitive answers. Students will dive deep into the media coverage of their favorite claims about what we know, debate the psychological science behind these claims, and develop transferable critical-thinking skills in the process.",

Students may work individually or in pairs to provide hearing loss intervention, auditory training, hearing loss prevention education, and communication strategy training. The student is expected to prepare for each session with a complete clinical plan, educational materials, and counseling strategies. Students must meet with the Audiologist prior to the aural rehabilitation (AR) session to discuss the plan of care. During the visit, the student will perform hearing loss handicap assessments, lead counseling sessions regarding rehabilitative options, make modifications to existing treatment plans/hearing aids, and educate the patient about their hearing. Following the visit, the student will document the encounter according to clinical protocol and ethical standards using the electronic medical records system. All patient-related information will be handled within a secure computer environment which meets HIPAA regulations for protected health information.",

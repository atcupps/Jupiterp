It examines the evolution of the People's Republic of China's (PRC) ethnic policies in relation to nation-state building over the last six decades. Specifically, it studies how the PRC has categorized the Chinese people into 56 ethnic groups, how it has made affirmative action policies to accommodate ethnic diversity, and what problems its approaches have experienced and what solutions it has proposed in its accommodation of ethnicity and diversity in the 21st century. To examine the above issues, the course introduces and applies the concepts of ethnicity, nationality, ethnic nationalism, civic nationalism, identity, social Darwinism, the Soviet model of multinational state building, the Chinese model of inclusive Chinese nation state building, citizenship, individual rights, group rights, equality, and diversity.",

These values create differential outcomes for the different people enmeshed in these systems, but both these values and these systems can be changed to support different values and different outcomes. The class serves as an introduction to the emerging field of algorithmic bias that bridges the disciplines of information science, computer science, law, policy, philosophy, sociology, urban planning, and others.",

The earlier part of the course focuses on explanations for behavior, while the later parts of the course focus more on the development and evaluation of tools for assisting people in cybersecurity.",

This course will equip and empower you to delve deep into understanding a social issue of your choosing. Through course materials and activities, you'll try out your changemaker muscles and mindsets. Our goal is that this course will empower you to be an informed, engaged citizen who contributes to your community with and beyond your profession. Along the way, we'll address questions like, \"What is social change?\" and \"What happens when our actions have unintended consequences?\" We'll talk about the importance of understanding, empathy, agency, and community, and reflect on how these concepts relate to us as individuals.",

Data storytelling enables us to communicate insights from data analyses to a broad audience and helps make the results meaningful through a narrative, or story, that provides context and inspires action. In this course, we will explore data storytelling through choreography and data embodiment-creating physical movement and video that reflects the meaning and context of the data. We will capture that movement and translate the recorded motion into visualizations with multimedia tools like TouchDesigner, culminating in a project to create a short video. Students will build data, technical and artistic fluencies through the experiential activities and the course project. Students with an arts background will gain exposure to visual programming tools and basic data manipulation that support creative processes. Students with a technical background will gain exposure to artistic processes and have the opportunity to leverage technical capabilities for multimedia content creation.",

Health data is complex, often unstructured and incomplete, and is organized for clinical care rather than to meet analytic needs. This course will involve the use of various analytical methods in order to translate large and complex data, whether structured or unstructured, into insights that improve decision-making from both the patient and provider perspectives. Healthcare data are rich and hold so much potential, but a challenge is presented to patients, providers, and even government agencies when it comes to figuring out how to leverage these data. Students in this course will learn foundational topics in data analytics focused on health data and will apply this knowledge to real health datasets through hands-on labs integrated into the lectures.",

Data storytelling enables us to communicate insights from data analyses to a broad audience and helps make the results meaningful through a narrative, or story, that provides context and inspires action. In this course, we will explore data storytelling through choreography and data embodiment-creating physical movement and video that reflects the meaning and context of the data. We will capture that movement and translate the recorded motion into visualizations with multimedia tools like TouchDesigner, culminating in a project to create a short video. Students will build data, technical and artistic fluencies through the experiential activities and the course project. Students with an arts background will gain exposure to visual programming tools and basic data manipulation that support creative processes. Students with a technical background will gain exposure to artistic processes and have the opportunity to leverage technical capabilities for multimedia content creation.",

Not only health care providers are relying on Health Technologies to improve patient care, people are increasingly using health devices and apps in their everyday life. Individuals have started using new technologies to collect data, increase awareness, and reflect on and change their behaviors. They also use various tools for curiosity and fun. This course will provide an overview of this exciting field and examine how social and behavioral theories can be applied to create effective health applications.It is difficult to create health technologies that can successfully be integrated into people's daily life due to many obstacles in individuals' data collection, integration, self-reflection, and sharing practices. Understanding these challenges is an important part of designing Health Technologies. Therefore, this course will cover HCI and design thinking methods that you can leverage in understanding the adoption of Health Technologies. Moreover, visualizations facilitate people to gain insights from their data, so we will cover common visualization approaches used in the personal data contexts.",

Thus, visual analytics bridges human-centered disciplines such as visualization and human-computer interaction with computation-centered disciplines such as machine learning, probabilistic methods, and knowledge discovery. The course contents will include both theoretical foundations of this interdisciplinary science as well as practical applications of integrated visual analysis techniques on real-world problems.",

      "description": "Information Studies' eclectic interdisciplinarity is both its greatest strength and its most significant weakness. As an increasingly multi/inter/trans/non-disciplinary intellectual community, Information Studies embraces a wide variety of conceptual frameworks, theories, methodological approaches, and intellectual traditions. As such, it is necessary to be able to bring many different intellectual perspectives to bear on the complex, nuanced, phenomena that are its focus. The variety in the intellectual toolbox of Information Studies is central to its ability to avoid reduction of its focal topics to trite, simplistic characterizations. However, the field's paradigmatic richness places particular burdens on the individual researcher. The purpose of this seminar is to help students develop a reflective practice that they can rely on to turn their interests into valuable new insights in an interdisciplinary domain like Information Studies.",

This course examines these questions by focusing on the labor process of computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW) in domains ranging from transportation to software development to sex work, drawing on research and theory from sociology, organizational studies, HCI, and more. Design-oriented students will be encouraged to develop interventions to enhance not just productivity but autonomy and democracy. Research-oriented students will learn to study workplaces and situate shopfloor developments in global political economy.",

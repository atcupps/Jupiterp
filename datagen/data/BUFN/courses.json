The projects will range from academic research projects (co-mentored by a finance or computer science faculty member) or an industry focused project (co-mentored by an industry coach). Each project must address an interesting real world challenge faced by a researcher, an analyst or a financial regulator.  The project would ideally use a real dataset. Teams can create their own datasets or re-purpose existing datasets. There will be credit given to teams who create or curate their own datasets. The project should apply methodology based in machine learning, information / data management, including NLP and text analytics. The project must include a visual analytics component so that the results from the project can be presented and explained to the user.",

This course will prepare students to deal with the complex issues involved in understanding those and other ecosystem services and their importance to society and environmental sustainability. Slowly, new markets are emerging for these services. Students will analyze the ecological, policy and financial dimensions of enhancing, restoring, and sustaining ecosystem services.

In this course, students will get answers to questions such as: how exactly does an aquaponics system work and what knowledge is needed to successfully run an aquaponics system? The different parts of this course will give the students an understanding of important topics in the field of aquaponics and develop a broad knowledge base: from water chemistry, fish and plant hysiology, to engineering and microbiology and show them how to plan and design such a sustainable production system. Aquaponics is a technique that combines aquaculture (fish farming) and hydroponics (soil-less plant cultivation) in a circulatory system with the aim of recycling nutrients from fish farming wastewater. Also, aquaponics can serve as a learning model for inter- and transdisciplinary thinking and acting.",

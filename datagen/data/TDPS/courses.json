Students will string together animations in various patterns and interactive systems, and design performance environments for them. Students will gain an understanding of motion that is assumed \"default,\" \"normal,\" and \"useful,\" and use their work to interrogate and challenge such assumptions and their social and political connotations. Then, students will try to recreate their digital action sequences in physical space, and re-translate them back into the virtual, building a new and improvednon-stock motionlibrary.\"",

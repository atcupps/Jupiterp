      "description": "Students, as they make use of evolving technologies, need to be able to present themselves effectively in front of any number of different audiences through any number of different outlets. Whether in an interview on radio, a guest presentation at a conference, in comments on a video blog, in commentary on TV, in the lead on a self-produced YouTube video, or as spokesperson in front of investors or management, professionals need strong oral communication skills. This class focuses on strengthening those skills through active individual and group presentations, as well as, through discussion of key techniques and group critique of presentation publicly available in the social media space on sites such as YouTube.",

The internet, tech companies and President Donald Trump delivered us to this historic place, as did the aspirations for democratic government overseas and the authoritarian reactions against those instincts and movements. We will examine the two parallel movements that define this era: disinformation as it spread from Russia in 2000 westward to the United States and state censorship as it exploded across the globe in reaction to the powerful, but short-lived 2012 Arab Spring. Can these instruments of authoritarianism be stopped?",

While questions about the future cannot be answered with any certainty, an exploration of the past allows us to see what happened when new technologies, information systems and practices appeared as possible tools for use by journalists and the communities they served. Students will learn to use resources for researching emerging media, including UMD library databases and open access sources. The course will include presentations by the instructor, discussions, field trips, in-class exercises and student presentations. Each student will engage in a research project to understand the experience of emerging media in a decade between 1820 and 1980. Students will also write an essay contemplating current trends and the future of emerging media.",

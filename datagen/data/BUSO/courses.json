This experience may be simulated through a software package or through content, speakers and events that are based in a realistic business setting. Students compete in teams. Each team makes decisions in areas such as human resources, compensation packages, geographic expansion through sales offices, debt versus equity financing, manufacturing and inventory management, marketing, including pricing, advertising and product design. The impact of each of these decisions flows through the three financial statements and results in financial outcomes and ratios that measure the success of each team. Additional metrics include stakeholders beyond investors such as employee morale, community engagement, and environmental impact. Students compete for financing and for customers. Multiple presentations are made by students during the simulation to explain their strategy, their tactics, and their planned investments.",

      "description": "The objective of the Action Learning Project I and II is for teams to identify and solve business problems that currently exist in organizations and in the process, to provide significant value to organizations and their stakeholders. The experience of solving business problems will both enable students to apply knowledge learned in core courses and to develop the wisdom, skills, and problem-solving capabilities of team members. This course is designed to promote independent learning. Faculty members will offer mini-modules on key themes such as team dynamics, client relations and consulting protocols but their primary role will be to facilitate the ALP process and serve as consultants to the student teams.Selecting the right project and defining it unambiguously sets the stage for the rest of the ALP process improvement or problem solving effort, ultimately leading to a relevant, value added and well-received deliverable. Poor problem selection creates longer-term problems for both ALP teams and the sponsoring organization and can reduce or impede the quality of your learning experience. For this reason, we will lay the foundation for the final selection of projects during this term (a) soliciting ideas from all students, and (b) offering feedback to identify and nurture the most promising ideas.",

The course integrates research findings from a range of different practical and intellectual perspectives, including psychology, sociology, economics, strategic management, and history into practical, hands on lessons for an entrepreneur. Class projects teach skills to explore high-risk business ideas in inexpensive ways and allow students to experience the entrepreneurial environment.A startup is an organization formed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model (Steve Blank). Entrepreneurship is about pursuing hunches about solutions to customer problems and thereby creating value. Testing these hunches requires getting customers to evaluate solutions. It is difficult to attract resources (either human or financial) before it is known if the hunch is correct, but testing hunches requires resources. This course provides iterative tools to solve this chicken and egg problem. We will also focus on specific skill building exercises, such as pitching and networking.",

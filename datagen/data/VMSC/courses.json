      "description": "The global burden of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases is growing and prompts the need for effective control of these pathogens. The objective of this course is to provide graduate students with knowledge of pathogenesis and transmission of globally evolving pathogens. Registered students for this course are expected to know fundamentals of infectious diseases. References from the peer reviewed journals will be provided to facilitate understanding of the selected topics. Opening of this course is necessary to help graduate students to stay up-to-date with currently emerging pathogens and their evolution with changes in environment. This course is complementary to other existing microbiology courses (i.e., Viral Pathogenesis) on campus. Lectures focus on an in-depth analysis of a variety of topics in current infectious diseases. The course highlights recently published literatures to evaluate evolving trends in infectious diseases. The covered topics include subjects related with various pathogens and their adaptation strategy to enhance pathogenicity and transmissibility. The lectures will also cover the control and prevention measures of these pathogens.",

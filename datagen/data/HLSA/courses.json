This new, modern vision for a health and wellness clinic embraces student involvement in designing, planning and contributing to innovative programs, solutions, and processes to improve the clinic's ability to meet community and patient needs by addressing the social determinants of health as well as traditional clinical health status. Students in the class will develop empathy for patients, providers and other stakeholders, define problems, select a specific problem for intervention, understand problems based on stakeholder input, ideate, reframe and suggest options to solve or address the problem, prototype solutions, test ideas, and make recommendations to inform implementation and ongoing measurement and monitoring of impact.",

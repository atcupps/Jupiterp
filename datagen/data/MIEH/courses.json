We will broadly review topics important to clinical research, including an overview of bioethics in research, the basics of clinical study structure and design, data collection, and the importance of good record keeping. You will apply this knowledge by developing your own clinical research project and creating a proposal in the structure of a grant funding application. You will also learn about topics related to clinical sample collection, including basic anatomy, the tools and procedures used, and the appropriate application of these procedures, as well as learning how to collect some basic clinical samples such as nasal swabs and blood samples.",

This course will focus on the science of infectious disease aerobiology and explore the historical roots of confusion and current political-economic forces that impede understanding and control of airborne infection transmission. Emphasis will be on reading and interpretation of original literature, understanding and using basic mathematical models, and evaluation of intervention strategies in the context of the hierarchy of hazard controls in public health.",

      "description": "History shows that the gap between the rich and the poor has varied over time within and between countries, most recently seeming to increase within many countries while somewhat decreasing between countries. This course challenges students to investigate why people make different amounts of money, why income inequality has changed dramatically in recent years, what public policy tools exist to counter inequality increases, and what different institutional arrangements different countries use to lower inequality. This course will introduce students to theoretical tools used by economists to understand the sources of inequality and will also examine various empirical measures of inequality.",

Will we destroy the environment by careless use of polluting energy, or we will find new and clean sources of energy that resolves the environmental issue once and for all? Will politicians and governments succeed in agreeing on a coherent strategy to deal with global issues related to energy, or do we expect individual countries to move in different directions and exacerbate the problems? Students will explore the demand and supply sides of the energy market and their relationships with government policies and environmental concerns. Students will also analyze empirical evidence to better understand the factors affecting energy production and consumption in the past and possible directions in the future. By examining past situations when technological change mitigated problems in energy markets, we can make informed predictions about what could happen next.",

First, its objective is to understand the role of financial markets for fluctuations in the macroeconomy. More specifically, starting from a complete markets benchmark, we study canonical types of credit market frictions that give rise to macroeconomic effects. Second, the course aims to enhance the students' toolkit to carry out state-of-the-art research in macroeconomics in general. It provides plenty of practical exercise to take models (usually DSGE models with financial frictions) to the computer. Third, alongside the methodological content, we revisit empirical facts on the regularities of financial variables, the 2008-09 global financial crisis and the Covid-19 recession.",

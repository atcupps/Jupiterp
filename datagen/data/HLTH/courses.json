Some examples of needs (deliverables) include: an infographic, a website, a curriculum, a lesson plan, an app, an evaluation plan, a policy brief, etc. Some examples of stakeholders: include legislators, non-profit organizations, a faculty researcher, a government (county, state or federal) agency, etc. The project is very applied in nature and the result is a deliverable that can be used immediately by the stakeholder.",

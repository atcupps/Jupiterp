Students will examine how CEEs shape human society and ecosystem from the interdisciplinary perspective afforded by the field of Geography. Students will use the latest geographic science concepts and techniques in exploring these events. Using satellite imagery they will gain a multi-scale perspective of the ecological and societal aspects of the events.",

To make use of enormous volumes of available data and geoinformation products, one has to know where and how to search and obtain the data, how to analyze the data, and how to extract useful information and knowledge. In this course, you will learn about the state-of-the-art Web-based tools that allow you to efficiently display and analyze a large number of datasets in a way many professionals working in the Earth science domain would. You will learn how to visualize multiple Earth science datasets produced by NASA in a variety of ways directly on the Internet, without the need to download, manage and store them. Students will be introduced to comprehensive functions to analyze the data and generate customized maps, animations, multi-variable correlations, regional subsetting, etc.",

In addition, students will develop a proficiency in applying these data structures to perform automated geospatial analysis, such as GIS operations, agent-based models, and spatial statistics.",

The use of remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) before, during, and after Hurricane Katrina and the 9/11 terror attacks are two of the case studies that are discussed during this course. You will develop a deeper understanding of the emergency management successes and failures that occurred during these historic and deadly events, and learn the technical skills to develop and disseminate GEOINT products that support decision-making at all four stages of emergency management.",

Students will be introduced to a range of methods that can be applied to the exploration, modeling, and visualization of big quantitative data. This course explores data cleaning, statistical analysis, and data-mining for geospatial and non-geospatial data in structured and unstructured form, with an emphasis on large silos of data across diverse sources and assumptions. Topics will include open sourcing, metadata schemes, data standards and models, data-access, data-mining, clustering methods, classifiers, data reduction, machine learning, filtering schemes, real-time and streaming data, archiving and preservation, and handling uncertainty.",

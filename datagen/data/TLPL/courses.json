Some families who began homeschooling or unschooling during the pandemic are continuing, despite the reopening of schools. In this course, we explore distance learning, unschooling, homeschooling and other alternative forms of education for children through reviewing research, readings, and videos, and by conducting in person and zoom interviews with parents, teachers and students of each of these education approaches. We address questions such as, How can an understanding of unschooling, homeschooling, distance schooling and other alternative learning experiences help educators improve their practices? What effects might these various alternatives have on children, families, communities, and society? What new alternatives to education are people using, and what innovations might be next?",

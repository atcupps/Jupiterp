The course works through exercises involving a number of autonomous robots (i.e., ground and air vehicles) that students will eventually use in their subsequent RAS minor courses. Topics include: ROS architecture, console commands, ROS packages, simulation environments, visualizations, autonomous navigation, manipulation, and robot vision.",

The second portionconcerns thestructures of offshore wind turbines and how they are installed. The third portion then looks at how the turbine is controlled to convert therotational kinetic energy to electricity in a safe and efficient manner. The fourth portion specializes in the environmental and financial issues associated with offshore wind farms. Finally the long term operations and maintenance of individual turbines and wind farms will be explored. Successful completion of this course should be sufficient to enable entry into the offshore wind industry while also encouraging the student to examine each of these five areas in more detail.",

The issues we consider include intercultural exchange and religious contexts, race and representation, and appropriation and iconoclasm.",

But does that mean that contemporary art is truly global? This course answers that question by examining the ways that art from Asia is exhibited, both in and outside of that region. Alongside this focus on exhibit ion, the course covers some of the key artistic movements and artists from countries in the region from 1989 to the present. The course does not offer a comprehensive view of this vast area of the world, but rather a survey of the field through the work of key scholars and critics and crucial events. Students learn to navigate the art world, at least digitally, which is a crucial set of skills for research on contemporary art. Students will complete an individual guided research project on a prominent artist from the region as well as a collaborative curatorial proposal.",

This course will introduce students to the films directed by some of the most representative filmmakers working in different geopolitical locations (mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong) and the Chinese diaspora. The films of these directors, in a spectrum of genres, themes, and styles, have inspired global scholarship, not only in visual culture and cinema, but also in the study of women's issues, gender and ethnic studies, as well as the fields of adaptation and intermedia studies. Students will explore these films in their socio-historical and artistic contexts, considering the influences and innovations that have shaped them and analyzing their reception by audiences and critics. After reading about the films they view, and participating in class discussions, students will be ready to complete their analytical written assignments, for which they will critically examine the films by applying key concepts such as gender, sexuality, race, gaze, style, representation, power, diaspora, etc.",

Recovered through humanistic research into classical art and literature, and likewise encountered in Judaeo-Christian scripture, this thematic paradigm was especially common in 17th- through 19th -century Europe, and is still reflected in today's popular media including television and film. Colloquium participants will explore this theme, surveying its elaboration in the visual and literary arts, and developing theories about its origin, affective power and contextual purposes.",

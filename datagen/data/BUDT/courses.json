Data, when used correctly, can create a competitive edge for firms. Advances in computing hardware and algorithms have improved the quality of predictions and effectiveness of predictive business applications. Expertise in working with data, and deep knowledge of data mining/machine learning methods, is a sought-after skill. This course introduces key tools and techniques of data mining: classification, prediction, cluster analysis, and text mining.  The methods covered are linear and logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, classification and regression trees, ensemble methods, neural networks, k-Means and hierarchical clustering, and association rules. The course will focus on business applications, with examples from Marketing, Finance, Healthcare, and Operations.",

      "description": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is penetrating our daily routines deeply and is revolutionizing almost every aspect of business. Firms are increasingly using technologies such as natural language processing, neural networks, and deep learning to generate deep insights. At the same time, AI algorithms are challenged by issues of bias, ethics, and transparency. This course aims to equip students with the essential knowledge of the current wave of AI. It uses a hands-on, learning-by-doing approach to understanding the concepts behind AI, the strategic drivers of these technologies and the value propositions that they provide to industries. The focus is on creating awareness of the technologies, allowing some level of familiarity with them through assignments, and enabling some strategic thinking around the use of these in business.",

This is followed by reviewing the computer science fundamentals related to cryptology, distributed computing, and peer-to-peer architectures that Blockchain systems rely on. The course then provides a comprehensive understanding of Bitcoin including its limitations, and the work that has been done to date to address these limitations. Alternate Blockchain implementations such as Ethereum and Hyperledger are discussed with a focus on smart contracts. The course will also cover potential business applications in Finance, Healthcare, Supply Chain, and Arts/Media/Entertainment. Students will be exposed to current research problems and research efforts in progress.",

      "description": "Race and gender have shaped computing from its earliest histories to contemporary debates over bias in search algorithms, surveillance, and AI. As computational processes shape ever more dimensions of everyday life from the personal to the global scale, understanding how they operate and how power operates within them grows ever more important. Combating racism and sexism is not as simple as ensuring the pool of programmers and engineers is more diverse; structures of power are embedded in digital technologies as they are in all aspects of our society, and we must learn to perceive their operation if we hope to transform them. We will examine how racism and sexism operate in the field of computer science and in everyday uses of digital technologies, while studying how feminist and racial justice movements have created alternative approaches. This class is for anyone who wishes to better understand the relationships between digital technology, structural power, and social justice.",

The course interrogates the ways that systems of hierarchy and privilege are created, enforced, and intersect through the language of race, class, sexuality, and national belonging. The course will provide students with the skills to examine how systems of power manifest in areas such as poverty, division of labor, health disparities, policing, violence. In addition to examining the impact of systems of power, students will reflect on their own location within the exercise of racialized, and gendered power relations.  This course encourages students to understand and critique these systems both personally and politically.",

Interrogating the categories of gender, sexuality, race, class, ability, the course will provide students with an examination of how artists have responded to pressing social justice issues of their eras. While the course centers visual art, students will also engage genres such as music, plays, literature, digital and performance art as arenas of social change.",

Topics such as what does a woman need in order to write, what role does gender play in the production, consumption, and interpretation of texts, and to what extent do women comprise a distinct literary subculture. Interpretation of texts will be guided by feminist and gender theory, ways of reading that have emerged as important to literary studies over the last four decades.",

The course also contends with the everyday experiences of LGBTQ subjects in the Black community.  Quare/Queer Contentions, therefore, interrogates the material realities of Black queer people in the context of family, religion, cultural/creative work, among others.

Our investigation will center on the liminal space between hegemonic culture and its prescribed excesses. These liminal spaces--between self and other, disability and enhancement, cultural hybridization, and gender crossing--shift in response to real-world sociopolitical tensions. We will consider feminist and anti-racist media scholars' concerns over representation, authorship and ideology alongside questions of technological change. Students will use analytical and creative assignments to explore not only how the scientific imaginary serves as fertile ground for feminist, disability, and anti-racist critique, but also provides a locus for alternative futures.",

Using a disability justice lens we'll explore debates within academic disability studies, examine historical and contemporary disability movements and modes of organizing, and build a repertoire of skills to engage in direct action as well as social policy and technological innovation using principles of universal design. We will consider a range of social theories centering disabled standpoints: the social model of disability, feminist disability theories, disability critical race theory (DisCrit), and queer crip theory. We'll also explore what it means to live a fulfilling crip life by exploring disability justice within the domains of education, parenting, and sexuality particularly while navigating the mental health and criminal justice systems.",

The curriculum draws upon the works of renowned artists such as Kent Monkman and Rebecca Belmore, as well as the insights of theorists like Gerald Vizenor and Leanne Betasamosake Simpson. These units encompass foundational understandings of aesthetics and contemporary Indigenous art; a contrastive study of Indigenous aesthetictheory with settler perspectives; an immersive focus on the artistry and significance of basket-making in Indigenous cultures;and reflections on Indigenous futurity in juxtaposition with settler temporal conceptions. Each unit is punctuated by a week of theoretical study, interactive coursework, and experiential learning through crafting and tactile interactions. A confluence of readings, multimedia resources, and hands-on experiences ensures participants gain a profound grasp of Indigenous artforms, histories, and visions for the future. For the course culmination, students will produce a final paper complemented by a reflective portfolio and a unique creative component.",

      "description": "Restricted to first semester first year students in the College of Arts and Humanities.<br><br> Twenty-something influencers such as Kylie Jenner and Shawn Mendes use social media to reach their millions of followers and to help shape what they think about, talk about, and purchase. Former Parkland, Florida student David Hogg shows how young people can affect social change by advocating for stricter gun control laws on national media outlets. Starting with these examples and drawing from literature, politics, and gender and sexuality studies, we will analyze youth and its power in our culture.",

How do machine learning models learn to determine the author of a text, or identify the artist behind a painting? What makes language models like ChatGPT different from image generators like Stable Diffusion? And can language models be used to make music? We will teach you how to build models that read and write in natural languages, what makes those models different from applications of machine learning to visual art and music, how to use Python for data analysis and statistics, how to visualize data, and how to apply mathematical and statistical knowledge to practical problems in the digital humanities. No background in coding or statistics is required, but students with some programming or statistics experience are also very welcome in the course.",

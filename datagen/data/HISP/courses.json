It focuses on the use of lasers to calculate 3-D measurements at various scales, from objects, to buildings, and landscapes. It will cover data management and archiving, field documentation processes, and post-processing of scan point clouds. This includes the production of deliverables for clients or project partners, such as plans, elevations, orthoimagery, and cleaned exported point clouds in formats that are compatible with Autodesk software and other CAD or rendering software platforms. This course is intended for students working in fields that rely on accurately documenting components of the built environment in three dimension, including architects, engineers, preservationists, archaeologists, or digital designers.",

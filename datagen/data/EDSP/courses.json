Internship II allows the intern to apply and integrate teaching competencies and responsibilities by systematically increasing independence in conducting all aspects of the special education mentor teacher's role. The intern will incrementally assume responsibility for planning, instruction, management, collaboration, and other essential tasks assigned in their internship placement. The intern will be responsible for the successful completion of edTPA, seminar assignments, and self-evaluation using Live Text for Foundational Competencies (FCs) and the Performance Based Assessment (PBA). Interns will be asked to recall and integrate course content from their prerequisite coursework during seminar and their eld placement experience.",

      "description": "The problem with decisions is that we rarely, if ever, find out if our decisions were good or bad.  Was choosing your major, for instance, a good decision or could you have made a better one?  I don't think most of us would ever know the answer to this question.  So, is it possible that we regularly make bad decisions but don't know that we do?  And, if so, how can we fix something if we don't know it is broken? In fact, we do regularly make bad decisions.  This has been shown in many experimental studies some of which will be covered in this class.  What is more, for some types of decision problems we are hardwired to make mistakes.  This means that we are bound to go wrong regardless of how much we know or how smart we are.  So, what can we do to remedy this problem?  Quite a bit, as it turns out.",

But, because it was also a human creation it has a large number of flaws derived from the political and economic realities of the day. In this course, we reconsider the U.S. Constitution and the political structures it created, with a view to proposing either constitutional amendments or even replacing it entirely with something better. Students will learn about the current constitutional structure, consider changes and updates to it, and attempt to negotiate and draft new constituional language for the government we need today.",

Topics to be covered include the sources of international law and the development of core legal principles in the post-WWII ear, the role of international economic institutions such as WTO, IMF, and World Bank in the global economy, and the influence of international institutions such as the UN Security Council, World Court, and International Criminal Court in addressing international security issues. Larger questions about the effectiveness of the WTO, Laws of War, and International Human Rights Law will be considered. The focus is on developing an understanding of central debates in the literature and primary empirical findings from quantitative and cross-national analyses that are of policy relevance.",

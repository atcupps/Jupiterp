# Jupiterp

Jupiterp is a website built to help students at the University of Maryland plan their schedules and make informed decisions about their course and section selections. Jupiterp provides a course planner that allows students to search for courses, see sections complete with professor reviews from [PlanetTerp](https://planetterp.com), and visualize their course schedule.

This repository is for the main Jupiterp site, which is built with SvelteKit and TypeScript. In addition to this repository, other components of Jupiterp can be found in the [jupiterp-umd](https://github.com/jupiterp-umd) GitHub group, including:
- The [Jupiterp API](http://api.jupiterp.com/), an open-source API for getting course data
- The Jupiterp web-scraper, which collects course information to be used in the site
- The [@jupiterp/jupiterp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jupiterp/jupiterp/) npm package, which provides a TS interface wrapping the Jupiterp API

Jupiterp is not officially affiliated with the University of Maryland; it is primarily managed and maintained by @atcupps. Contact admin@jupiterp.com for any inquiries.

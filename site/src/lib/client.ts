 * The API this site talks to.
 *
 * Overridable so that pointing the site at a local API is a shell variable
 * rather than a source edit:
 *
 *     PUBLIC_JUPITERP_API=http://localhost:8080 npm run dev
 * 
 * Note the scheme: the local API serves plain HTTP, so `http://localhost:8080`.
 * `https://` there fails the TLS handshake and surfaces as a network error with
 * no response at all, which reads like the server being down.
 *
 * Unset, this is production, so nothing changes for a normal build or deploy.

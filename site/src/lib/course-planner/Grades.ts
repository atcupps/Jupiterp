 *
 * @fileoverview Shaping and formatting for grade distributions.
 *
 * Grade data comes from UMD's Office of the Registrar, obtained by MPIA
 * request, and is aggregated by the database. This module used to fetch raw
 * per-section records from PlanetTerp and sum them in the browser; that
 * aggregation is gone, along with its GPA formula.
 *
 * ## Why the GPA formula changed
 *
 * There were two of them, and they disagreed. The client-side
 * `gpaFromLetters()` counted withdrawals in the denominator with weight zero;
 * the database's `umd_gpa()` excludes them. Both comments cited PlanetTerp as
 * their source, so at most one was right.
 *
 * The gap is not a rounding difference. For a 100-student course with 90
 * letter grades averaging 3.00 and 10 withdrawals, excluding W gives 3.00 and
 * including it gives 2.70 -- and the gap is widest in high-withdrawal courses,
 * which are exactly the hard ones students look up. Shipping both would have
 * put two different numbers for the same course on screen at once.
 *
 * The database is right, so the site now takes `gpa` from the API and does not
 * compute one. A W does not appear in a transcript GPA, which is what students
 * are comparing against. Withdrawals are still shown, as their own bar, where
 * a 20% withdrawal rate is a signal in its own right rather than something
 * blended into an average.
 *
 * ## Two denominators
 *
 * They are not interchangeable, and the popover says which is which:
 *
 *   GPA         over `graded`     -- letter grades only, no W
 *   Bar percent over `graded + w` -- so the bars sum to 100% and W is visible
 *
 * Neither is `total`. Before Fall 2017 the registrar's total includes students
 * whose outcome was never categorized, so it is not comparable across eras.
